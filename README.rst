Abstract
-----------

This paper studies a value function iteration algorithm based on
nonexpansive function approximation and Monte Carlo integration that can
be applied to almost all stationary dynamic programming problems.  The
method can be represented using a randomized fitted Bellman operator and a
corresponding algorithm that is shown to be globally convergent with
probability one.  When additional restrictions are imposed, an
:math:`O_P(n^{-1/2})` rate of convergence for Monte Carlo error is obtained.

Code

Python code can be found in the zip file posted above, 
and also on the `Google code site <https://sites.google.com/site/fviprobone/home>`_.
Matlab code is posted below.  The code is written by my RA Alex Olssen, and
replicates figure 3 in the paper.  There are two files, and the content is well documented and self-explanitory.

Some general comments on coding are as follows: First, the paper suggests
kernel smoothers as one possible nonexpansive approximation method, and linear
interpolation as another.  In subsequent experiments, we've found that kernel
smoothers are usually a waste of time.  Linear interpolation is almost always
easier and better.  A second comment is that if you are working in a low
dimensional setting and find that Gaussian quadrature is more efficient than
Monte Carlo, there's no problems with using it:  Gaussian quadrature paired
with a nonexpansive approximator should again be nonexpansive.
